Workflow for movie categorization
1. Create an array of movies state in appjs
2. create a function that receive the movie and add to the 
collections list, #1
3. Pass the function #2 down to the custom card component and 
receive as props
4. Once received as props, invoke the function, in point #3, trigger on 
button click and pass parameter either "happy" or "lazy"
5. #2 function will receive the argument happy or lazy and add, now add that the 
object as new property, ie "category"
6. push the movie object to the collection, #1.
7. create a component that will list the movies, reuse the custom card to
show the movie the list section
